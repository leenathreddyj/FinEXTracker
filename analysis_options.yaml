# This file configures the analyzer for FinEXTracker, which statically analyzes
# Dart code to check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors) used for FinEXTracker development.
# The analyzer can also be invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Activates recommended lints for FinEXTracker Flutter app,
# designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to FinEXTracker can be customized below to disable
  # rules from `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` or enable additional ones.
  # A list of all available lints and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project below, it can also
  # be suppressed for a single line of code or a specific Dart file by using
  # `// ignore: name_of_lint` or `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
